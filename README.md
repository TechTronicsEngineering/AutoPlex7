## Control seven segment displays with ease.

AutoPlex7 is a simple and versatile Arduino library for controlling seven segment displays with up to four digits. Unlike many other libraries for this purpose, AutoPlex7 automatically multipexes itself using Timer2. This means no refresh calls; enabling AutoPlex7 to work with delays in your code.

### Features
- Automatic multiplexing
- Built to work with delays in your code
- Works with both common cathode and common anode displays
- Has a flexible pin layout; letting you connect any display pin to any of Arduino's digital pins.
